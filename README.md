# Arduino.MidiPiano
Convert standard 61 key keyboard into a midi device!<br><br>
This project uses [HIDUINO](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/hiduino) and [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) UNO.<br>
If you want this to work you need to upload the sketch first, then flash your ATmega 8u2/16u2 with HIDUINO.<br><br>
Source code is intendend to work with Yamaha PSR300. If you have different keyboard, you will probably need to modify it.

### TODO
* Implement piano pedals (soft/sostenuto/sustain)
* Maybe comment the source code more
* Create wiki/tutorial on how to upload sketch and flash ATmega?
